#first I will find the cumulative sum of 1/n
#as n starting from 1 to 900000 (which will give us a highly precise answer)
sum=0
for n in range (1,900000):
    sum += 1/(n**2)

#the result we obtain equals to (pi^2/6) therefore we need to divide it by 6 and get the squareroot
pi=(sum*6)**(1/2)
print (pi)
